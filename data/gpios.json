The UART pins are useful for setting up a headless Pi (a Pi without a screen) and getting it connected to a network. UART can be used to talk to Serial GPS modules or sensors such as the PM5003, but you must make sure you disable the Serial Console in raspi-config first. On the Pi 3 and 4 the UART is, by default, used for Bluetooth and you may need to add dtoverlay=miniuart-bt to /boot/config.txt to achieve a stable.
